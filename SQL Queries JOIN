1. I want to know how many employees with each title were born after 1965-01-01.
        SELECT e.emp_no, title, birth_date
    -> FROM employees e
    -> INNER JOIN titles ON e.emp_no=titles.emp_no
    -> WHERE birth_date >= '1965-01-01';

2. I want to know the average salary per title.
        SELECT title, avg(salary)
    -> FROM titles
    -> INNER JOIN salaries ON titles.emp_no=salaries.emp_no
    -> GROUP BY title;

3. How much money was spent on salary for the marketing department between the years 1990 and 1992?
SELECT d.dept_name, sum(s.salary) AS total_salary
    -> FROM salaries s
    -> INNER JOIN dept_emp de ON s.emp_no=de.emp_no
    -> INNER JOIN departments d ON d.dept_no=de.dept_no
    -> WHERE d.dept_name = 'Marketing' AND s.from_date >= '1990-01-01' AND s.to_date <= '1992-12-31'
    -> GROUP BY d.dept_name;
